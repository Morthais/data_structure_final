# Introduction

Hello, World! Welcome to my Data Structures Tutorial! I hope you're ready to learn about stacks, linked lists, and trees. Before diving in to the first lesson, please read the general Helpful Knowledge section for ideas that may help you wrap your head around these data structures if you learn them well enough.

The lessons all follow a similar pattern, with important variations depending on the data structure. Since all data structures are different, may be useful to read each lesson from beginning to end before working on the problem. This way you may be introduced to the data structure, learn how it is built, and see functions that will help you solve the problem. Following this pattern will increase your ability to learn the data structure.

Thank you for your interest in my tutorial! I hope you learn something new that can be used throughout your journey in Computer Science. Please get in touch with me if you have any questions! I'm always open to new ideas and constructive feedback, so work through this tutorial and let me know what you think!

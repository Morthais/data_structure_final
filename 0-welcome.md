# Welcome!

Hello, World! Welcome to my Data Structures Tutorial! I hope you're ready to learn about the stack, linked list, and tree. Before diving in to the first lesson, please read the Helpful Knowledge for ideas that may help you wrap your head around these data structures.

The lessons all follow a similar pattern with important variations depending on the data structure. As a word of advice, it may be useful to read each lesson completely from beginning to end. Above all else... practice, practice, practice! Follow along and transcribe the examples as you read. Actually writing the software has a way of teaching us much faster than any reading can.

Thank you for your interest in my tutorial! I hope you learn something new. Please get in touch with me if you have any questions! I'm always open to new ideas and constructive feedback, so work hard through this tutorial and let me know what you think!

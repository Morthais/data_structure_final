## Introduction

Imagine your biological family history. If you are like most people then you have one mother and one father. Following this pattern, each pf your parents also has a mother and a father (you call these your grandparents). Yet further, back to the beginning of time, every person has one biological mother and father. We call a visual representation of this a family tree. Trees are a useful data structure for representing genealogy, but they have other uses as well. We won't go into applied trees in this tutorial, but you will learn how to build a basic binary tree and a few functions used to operate upon a binary tree.

## Helpful Python Module

The first link is to a Python binarytree library from the Python Package Index. It allows you to declare a tree object and perform some operations to navigate, display, and interact with the tree. This is optional learning and may or may not help you with the problem above.

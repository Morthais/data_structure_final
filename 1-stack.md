## Introduction

What is a stack? Imagine you are building a pile of bricks. A pile of bricks is built by placing one brick on top of another until you run out of bricks to put on the pile. If you want to get to the bricks at the bottom, you need first to take from the top. You can do other things like count the bricks and verify that you have the right amount, but that doesn't change the fact that the last brick you put on the pile is the first one you take off. We call this rule the Last In First Out (LIFO) structure and it is key to understanding stacks. A stack is essentially a pile of bricks. You can only push to and pop from the top of a stack. You can do other things like check the length of the stack and verify that number is correct, but anything below the top is not accessible by you until the items on top have been removed first nor can you add any items to the middle of a stack, just as you wouldn't be able to with a stack of bricks unless you remove the bricks above that spot first.

## Functions

What is the performance of a stack? NOTE: This should probably be answered in the functions section, showing the Big O Notation of each function.
